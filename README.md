# 1812 Overture

This project is a learning excerscise in simulating collisions with objects in code and working with sound, you press space to shoot a ball out of a cannon and the balls create sound based off of the material set in the walls (hence the reference to 
to the Overture by Tchaikovsky)

## Current version Demo (no sound integration yet)
